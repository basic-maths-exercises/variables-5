# Using variables in equations

Congratulations on completing the previous exercise!  Now that you understand how to set variables lets look how we can use them when writing equations.  Consider the following code:

````
a = 4+5
b = 2*a
print(b)
````

When you insert this code into the code area on the left of the screen the number 18 will be output as the variable a is first set equal to 9 (4+5).  The variable b is then set equal to the value of the variable a, which is 9, multiplied by 2.

The fact that we can use variables in equations allows us to break up complicated expressions into simpler parts.  Furthermore, if we print out the values of the variables in the simpler parts we can check our working as we move through the calculation.

To see if you understand this idea I want you to evaluate the following expression:

![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=r=\frac{(4%2B5)(3%2B\frac{1}{2})}{7(10-4)}

I want you to do this by following the instructions given below:

1. Set a variable called `numerator` equal to the numerator in the quotient above.
2. Set a variable called `denominator` to the denominator of the quotient above. 
3. Set a variable called `r` equal to the variable `numerator` divided by the variable `denominator`. 
4. Finish by setting the variable called `numerator` equal to 4

The tests I have written will check that the variables I have asked you to define in the instructions above have been defined and set correctly.
